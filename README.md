## “WMATA(Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority) Crime Analysis” 


### Ⅰ. Introduction
#### Mission Statement 
The mission of this project is to analyze the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) performance records related to crime incidents, customer and employee injuries, and stations. By organizing these records within a structured database and applying analysis, we seek to derive recurring safety trends and patterns across the WMATA systems. The ultimate goal of this project is to generate clear, data-driven insights that can be utilized to improve overall passenger and employee safety throughout the WMATA transit network.

#### Mission Objectives
To achieve this mission, we focus on four specific objectives. First, we analyze how the number of crime incidents varies by time of day and between peak and off-peak hour periods to understand how the level of risk varies across different times of day. This comparison is intended to show whether particular time windows require prioritized attention from WMATA and the Metro Transit Police. 

Second, we identify how total crimes and injuries change over time 2020 to 2022. Tracking these trends helps identify how the safety conditions have been changing over the years, including whether incidents are increasing or decreasing, which can be utilized by the WMATA when building future safety initiatives or evaluating their effectiveness. 

Third, we determine which stations and rail lines experience the highest frequency of daily incidents. Determining these high-risk locations provides a basis of prioritizing limited safety resources towards the stations within the network with the greatest need, increasing the resource utilization of the WMATA. 

Finally, we identify which offense types occur most frequently within the transit system, and how their frequency changes over time. We believe understanding the relative frequency of different offenses will help to highlight the types of incidents that impose burden on the riders, employees and WMATA system operations.

### Limitations
One limitation of this analysis is the absence of ridership data for each station. Because we only used raw incident counts, stations with higher passenger volume would naturally appear to have more crime. Having ridership data would have allowed us to normalize crime incident counts and compare stations fairly.
